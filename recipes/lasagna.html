    <h1> Lasagna Recipe </h1>
    <img width="700" height="500" src="lasagna.webp">
    <p>While there are a few steps to this lasagna recipe, it’s easy to make and has so much flavor. 
        This dish can be made ahead of time and freezes well either before or after baking!</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese Filling: </strong>For this classic lasagna recipe, 
            the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings 
            and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem,
            cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li> 
        <li><strong>Meat: </strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. 
            If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to
            the meat mixture for flavor.</li>       
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce 
            (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes 
            if you’d prefer).</li>

        <li><strong>Spinach (variation):</strong> To make a spinach lasagna, 
            squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted 
            frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer</li>
    </ul>
        <h2> Preparation </h2>
        <p> Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – 
            and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal! 
            This is a really easy lasagna recipe.
