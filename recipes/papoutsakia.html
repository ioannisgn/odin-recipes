<p> Greek stuffed eggplant recipe may be simple, 
    but it’s not lacking in flavor! Packed with ground beef, 
    fresh vegetables, herbs, spices, mashed potatoes, 
    these homemade stuffed eggplants are a meal in themselves,
    but you can always serve with with a side salad or some roasted 
    vegetables and some crusty bread!</p>
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><Strong>Eggplants</Strong>: These are the star of this dish, so look for eggplants at your local 
        grocery store or farmers market that are firm to the touch and a rich, dark purple.
        Avoid eggplants that are too soft or speckled with bad spots. Wash thoroughly before 
        preparing this Greek stuffed eggplant recipe.
    </li>
    <li>
        <Strong>Béchamel Sauce</Strong>: This really elevates this stuffed eggplant recipe to the next level. 
        It is optional, but highly recommended. If you love creamy homemade béchamel sauce,
        then I am sure you will fall in love with the traditional pastitsio, aka Greek 
        lasagna!
    </li>
    <li>
        <Strong>Red Wine</Strong>: This helps to deglaze the skillet in which the vegetables and
         ground beef are cooked in, and it imparts a ton of delicious flavor.
        Just make sure to cook it for a couple minutes to allow the alcohol to evaporate.

</ul>
<h2> Preparation </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare this delicious Greek stuffed eggplant dish (‘melitzanes papoutsakia’ 
        recipe), the eggplants are first seasoned and baked until soft and sweet.</li>
    <li>Then you proceed to make the tomato based meat sauce, just like you would for 
        your typical spaghetti bolognese. Start by simmering the onions, adding the 
        spices and the mince meat. Let the meat sizzle till golden brown, add the 
        tomato sauce and let it simmer till it thickens.</li>
    <li>Lastly you prepare the béchamel sauce. Melt some butter in a pan, add the flour and then 
        slowly add the milk while whisking over low heat. When the béchamel sauce has thickened,
         add the egg yolks, nutmeg and salt and whisk. Then its time to assemble!</li>
    <li>Layer your baked aubergines, add a couple of generous spoonfuls of the meat sauce, 
        a generous spoonful of your bechamel and top with the grated cheese. Bake till 
        golden brown. Delicious!</li>
